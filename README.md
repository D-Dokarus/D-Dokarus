# Bonjour ! I am Dorian Correia-Mateus

I am currently in my 4th year of engineering school in computer science and management at Polytech Montpellier, in France
I know how to code in Python, Java, JS, C++... but I can learn new langages if needed

## Work Experiences
In 2021, I did a 3 months internship at the Istre's air base where I work on a template software in C++. It was an application to help people carrying out tests on helicopters to record the results on a tablet instead of using dozens of sheets of paper. The aim was to prove the usefulness of such an application.

Then in 2023, for my engineering studies, I did a 3 months internship at Stockholm, in Sweden, at Yayloh, a start-up that offers a platform that facilitates the returns process for retailers and customers. Yayloh's application provides users with a dashboard enabling them to manage their own customer returns in real time and observe the related statistics. In the long term, the application enables companies to understand the reasons for returns and thus reduce them.

## Personal Experiences
I am currently working on multiple project, for instande TimelineDreamer, a timeline manager to help people organize their thoughts or visualize a chronological history. One of the reason I am working on it is to help me desing my futur video game.
